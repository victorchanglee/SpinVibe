abstract = {Spin-phonon coupling is the main driver of spin relaxation and decoherence in solid-state semiconductors at finite temperature. Controlling this interaction is a central problem for many disciplines, ranging from magnetic resonance to quantum technologies. Spin relaxation theories have been developed for almost a century but often use a phenomenological description of phonons and their coupling to spin, resulting in a nonpredictive tool and hindering our detailed understanding of spin dynamics. Here, we combine time-local master equations up to the fourth order with advanced electronic structure methods and perform predictions of spin-phonon relaxation time for a series of solid-state coordination compounds based on both transition metals and lanthanide Kramers ions. The agreement between experiments and simulations demonstrates that an accurate, universal, and fully ab initio implementation of spin relaxation theory is possible, thus paving the way to a systematic study of spin-phonon relaxation in solid-state materials. Ab initio open quantum system theory can predict spin-phonon relaxation time in solid-state magnetic systems.}}

abstract  ="Creating the next generation of quantum systems requires control and tunability{,} which are key features of molecules. To design these systems{,} one must consider the ground-state and excited-state manifolds. One class of systems with promise for quantum sensing applications{,} which require water solubility{,} are d8 Ni2+ ions in octahedral symmetry. Yet{,} most Ni2+ complexes feature large zero-field splitting{,} precluding manipulation by commercial microwave sources due to the relatively large spin–orbit coupling constant of Ni2+ (630 cm−1). Since low lying excited states also influence axial zero-field splitting{,} D{,} a combination of strong field ligands and rigidly held octahedral symmetry can ameliorate these challenges. Towards these ends{,} we performed a theoretical and computational analysis of the electronic and magnetic structure of a molecular qubit{,} focusing on the impact of ligand field strength on D. Based on those results{,} we synthesized 1{,} [Ni(ttcn)2](BF4)2 (ttcn = 1{,}4{,}7-trithiacyclononane){,} which we computationally predict will have a small D (Dcalc = +1.15 cm−1). High-field high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data yield spin Hamiltonian parameters: gx = 2.1018(15){,} gx = 2.1079(15){,} gx = 2.0964(14){,} D = +0.555(8) cm−1 and E = +0.072(5) cm−1{,} which confirm the expected weak zero-field splitting. Dilution of 1 in the diamagnetic Zn analogue{,} [Ni0.01Zn0.99(ttcn)2](BF4)2 (1′) led to a slight increase in D to ∼0.9 cm−1. The design criteria in minimizing D in 1via combined computational and experimental methods demonstrates a path forward for EPR and optical addressability of a general class of S = 1 spins."}
