# SpinVibe


**SpinVibe** is an open-source Python package for simulating **spinâ€“phonon coupling in molecular qubits** using first-principles calculations.  
It is desgin to study molecular qubits in solid-state systems.

## Inputs
- Solid-state phonons and eigenvectors
- Molecular spin-hamiltonian parameters (e.g. g-factor, zero-field splitting tensor)
- Parameters: Temperature, Polarization, external magnetic field, etc.

## Output
- Time evolution of the spin density and magnetization
- Spin-phonon relaxation time (T1)
